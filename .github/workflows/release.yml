        # This is kept as a separate step to avoid breaking releases

        # In the event that you or this script does mess it up, or you want to add a new Google Sheets file, do these:
        # 1. For a new file, create a new Google Sheets file in the Google Drive folder.
        #    Otherwise, open the file you want to update.
        # 2. Rename your local CSV file like "item_source_info_table.csv" -> "Item_Source_Info_Table.csv".
        # 3. Import the CSV into the Google Sheets file, replace the existing spreadsheet.
        # 4. If the Google Sheets file is unnamed, rename it to the same name as the worksheet name.
        # 5. Run this action or script again. The script checks per build and per file what it can update,
        #    but doing it per file every time is more straightforward.
