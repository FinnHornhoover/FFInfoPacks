# FFInfoPacks

Do you need icons of items, monsters, NPCs, etc. for your FusionFall-related project? Have you ever needed to analyze the game data and relate everthing to everything by hand, but found that too time-consuming? Do you just want in-depth game information without a need to write any code? **FFInfoPacks** is for you!

This project is a collection of ZIP files that are released for every OpenFusion-based FusionFall version that contains just what you need!

## Download

Just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/FinnHornhoover/FFInfoPacks/releases) and download the ZIP file for the version you need from the latest release.

## Features

You will find the following stuff in the ZIP files:

**Area Info**: An area boundary JSON file for each build, that refers to game coordinates and area width and height values.

## Caveats

- While mostly ironed out, there may be some inaccuracies with stuff in the `info` folder. Please report any issues to me here or on Discord.
- Retrobution data is included with permission from the Retrobution team. As such, the data you receive may have missing items, NPCs, etc. that are present in the game files but are not released yet. We will always try our best not to spoil the endeavors of Retrobution developers and maintainers, so we may hold off on releasing new info packs until after some time passes on updates.
- You should always verify the data yourself if it is critical to your project. Casual use of the data is always welcome.
